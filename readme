This project is about writing a SQLBuilder and is very useful when I am doing some testing. Typically I need to 
write code that is very SQLish and hard to maintain. 

A builder allows me to write code like 

		insertBuilder.add("real", "networks");
		insertBuilder.add("status", "approved");

And then generate something like :
                insert into TestTable (real, status) values ('networks', 'approved')

It is easy to read and work with
